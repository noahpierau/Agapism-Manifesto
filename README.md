# Agapism Manifesto

We need a new narrative. One that can unify humanity. One that does not discriminate. One that protects and serves. One that is patient and kind — embracing diversity and promoting pluralism. It is essential that we find such a story, the future of humanity may depend on it.

Our beliefs and stories from past times have resulted in global societies in which chaos, fear and uncertainty are ever increasing. However, human beings are not the only victims of previous narratives: the plants and animals on this planet are suffering as well.

In this manifesto, Agapism is presented as a narrative to inspire human beings to unite in becoming good stewards of this planet we call home.

Agapism is a not a new philosophy. It comes from the Ancient Greek word *Agape*, which means [a deep and profound love that transcends and persists regardless of circumstance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape). In short:

> **Agapism is the belief in unconditional, universal love.**

# What is Love?

When you read the teachings of Jesus Christ, the word Love will appear frequently. In texts from Buddhism, Hinduism or Jainism you will find Metta, or Maitri, Maitra and Mitra, which are derived from the Sanskrit word Mid, which means Love. Furthermore, in the Muslim tradition one of the names for God is “Al-Wadud”, which means the All-Loving.

All names given to Love in all languages are worthy of respect. However, if we are to become good stewards of this planet, we must arrive at a common understanding of the core principles of Love.

So, what does Love really mean?

> **Love means: being in an open connection, so that energy may flow freely.**

While this definition sounds simple, the amount of work required to fully understand the core principles is significant. We must understand what it means to be, how to establish an open connection, what the different forms of energy are, and how we can enable a free flow.

It is beyond the scope of this manifesto to go into detail on each of these principles, simply because there is too much information to share. We also believe that everyone should do their own research instead of relying on external experts. An overview of Love is given below:

### 1: being in an open connection
The first principle of Love teaches us to [distinguish the being-mode from the having-mode](https://wiseandshinezine.com/2022/04/16/erich-fromm-on-having-versus-being/). In the having-mode we categorize things and we try to manipulate or control them. This mode is needed to survive. In the being-mode we are not concerned with having something but rather by being or becoming something. These are things that an individual does not own or possess. One may lose some of their possessions or status during hardships, but what remains the same is who they are as a human being: the virtues and character traits such as courage, humility, honesty, integrity and compassion. The being mode is not static, it’s an ongoing process.

Being in Love is a process of [reciprocal opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o65qmyAeOM). When we participate in Love, we don’t relate to people categorically — in a passive way — but we participate in an ongoing process of transforming our perspectives and opening up to each other. If this is successful, a connection is established and a relationship is possible. Being in relation to something or someone implies that there is an open connection. This can happen on multiple levels: we can relate to ourselves, to others, to a greater good such as an organization or a nation, and to a "smaller good" such as a bird, a flower, a stone or a grain of sand. 

Since ancient Greece, philosophers have tried to distinguish different types of relationships in which Love can manifest:

- self-directed love (*Philautia*);
- love of romantic partners (*Eros*);
- love of friends and equals (*Philia*);
- love of family and relatives (*Storge*);
- universal, unconditional love (*Agape*);

The philosophy of Agapism is to focus on Agape relationships. What this means will be explained in the next section.

### 2: so that energy may flow freely
There are different forms of energy that can flow in a relationship. Energy in this context should be interpreted in multiple ways: it can mean physical efforts and acts of service, but also subtle energy forms such as cooking food, singing songs, sharing feelings and emotions, as well as cognitive energy in the form of jokes, ideas or mental models.

Depending on the type of connection, different forms of energy are shared among the participants. The relationship is sustainable when there is a healthy balance in the flow of energy. 

When imbalances in the energy flow arise, Love propels each participant to restore the balance. When a connection is not based on Love the imbalances may persist. This is associated with suffering. To identify any imbalance in the flow of energy, we must listen carefully to ourselves, to others, and to the greater good.

Since energy is always in motion, keeping a healthy balance is an ongoing process. Being in Love is therefore active work. This is perhaps the reason why some people give up on Love: they expect to "have" it once they experience it, but this is impossible. Clear communication is key to balance the flow of energy.

It depends on the participants whether they allow energy to flow freely or whether they choose to maintain certain boundaries. Examples of when boundaries might be needed: other dedicated relationships, time limits, or low energy levels. It is essential to keep track of our internal energy level: when we are drained from power it will be hard to share anything with others. It takes self-knowledge to realize which boundaries are needed, and it takes skill to communicate them clearly.

It is also important to note that boundaries are different from barriers which are blocking the flow. Barriers may have been created as defense mechanisms to protect ourselves from pain in the past, but in the present these automatic reactions may prevent Love from manifesting. Yet again, it takes self-knowledge to understand which defenses are needed, and which ones can be discarded.

Rumi, a 13th-century poet from Persia, put it this way:

> *“Your task is not to seek for Love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it”*

### Further reflections
Love is a natural phenomenon in the universe. It is the most profound way of being. Without it, there would be no collaboration and no evolution. Love is therefore central to reason and rationality as well: many of us would be stuck in the gravity well of ego-centrism without it.

Notice that we have spelled Love with a capital L so far. This is because we wanted to describe the phenomenon. When it manifests in the world, we will call it love with a small l to make the distinction.

Now that we have a common understanding of the core principles, it’s time to explore Agapism in more detail.

# Why Agapism?

What is needed more than ever is Agape. In our modern societies we are severely lacking compassion, community, and human connection.

Agape is the highest aspect of Love that we can reach. It is demonstrated by our dedication to heal, by being aware of how our actions affect the greater good of mankind, by showing random acts of kindness, by improving the lives of others, all without expecting anything in return.

Love in the form of Agape simply means we will do what will best benefit all beings. Doing what will best benefit all beings includes us as well. When we are the ones who need help the most, we can open ourselves up to receive the energy of others. We should not be afraid to speak up when we are struggling with the obstacles of life — it is not just OK to ask for help, Agape encourages us to do so.

Agapism acknowledges that love can be difficult, both for others and for ourselves. It can require us to help others even when we don’t think they would do the same for us. It tells us to be generous to those we dislike or even despise. However, there is value in the difficulty of love. By making the effort to love our enemies, we grow our capacity to Love.

### Meaning in the universe
Agapism teaches that the universe has a meaning to it and that each of us are here for a reason. Generally speaking this reason is to experience life in order to learn how to love wisely. Even though we all have the same goal, the specifics of these experiences and lessons are different for everyone. Some people are here to learn generosity, some are here to learn humility, and others are here to learn forgiveness. There is no single correct path for everyone and there is not supposed to be. We are all unique with our own skills and ideas. Even though we are all here to learn how to love, how to do this wisely is different for everyone.

> *“Love is a seed that can flourish in the most unlikely places. This mysterious and magical joy is the greatest treasure of all”*

Agapism teaches that all experiences matter. Some experiences may seem arbitrary or pointless to some, but they can be the exact experiences that others are living for. And while some experiences may seem cruel or unfair they can be as important and beneficial as the “good” ones. We are here to learn through trial and error and self-reflection, and although there may be pain, in the end we will grow stronger because of it.

Ultimately, the core teaching of Agapism is: to love wisely. This means that we live in harmony with ourselves, with others, and with the greater good in which we participate. When we heal and remove all the barriers that prevent us from Love, we are able to love the *greatest good*, which some people describe as God. This is the ultimate state of being. Every religion has their own way of explaining this phenomenon, but in essence it means that we live in harmony with all beings.

Life is not a race and everyone follows their own path. We do not have to force ourselves to love differently than we currently can. As we grow over time, we will become better stewards of our planet.

# How will Agapism work?

Agapists, the people that identify with Agapism, aim for the creation of a movement without dogma or rigid belief systems.

Agapism is an open source movement, which means truth is not based on an external authority (via dogma or imposed truths), but rather on the collective human experience of reality.

The core principles and beliefs, including this manifesto, are created and refined through the open source truth process. Placing this process at the heart of Agapism is a necessary safeguard against the dogmatic pitfalls that typically plague communities built on shared beliefs.

The open source truth process was [created by Yoism](https://github.com/noahpierau/bookofyo#open-source-truth), the first open source religion to ever exist. This process ensures a living religion whose writings will evolve over time, through continuous reflection, growth, and evolution of the collective intelligence.

Everyone in the movement is invited to provide input and improvements, based on their own direct experience of reality. In a participatory process we will gradually uncover, refine, and document The Truth — the clearest expression of our system of ideas and beliefs that is consistent with reality as it is directly experienced.

### Practices and gatherings
Agapists believe in synergy with science, and seek to integrate our modern scientific world view with relevant traditions and practices.

To paraphrase the [words of John Vervaeke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yImlXr5Tr8g):

*The very processes that make us adaptive and intelligent subject us to problems of self-deception and self-destruction. We create bullshit for ourselves, for other people, and for the world around us. This can cause anxiety, despair, or a sense of absurdity. Across cultures and historical periods, human beings have created sets of practices to ameliorate these perennial problems.*

Agapists may explore and participate in different practices, to find out what works for them and what makes them flourish. Local networks with others may be created to form communities of practice.

Community gatherings can include prayer, meditation, yoga, conversation, debate, philosophy, studying nature, hiking, making music, dancing, and many other activities. Agapists often adopt rituals or practices from other groups and adapt them to align with Agape.

Agapism does not prescribe any specific worldview. Everyone has their own understanding of the world, and this is respected. You may be Agapist in parallel to being Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, atheist, nihilist or non-theist. Agapism encourages religious pluralism.

We refer to [an old prophecy of the Cathars](https://www.oshonews.com/2011/01/06/the-cathar-prophecy/): that a Church of Love would grow from our combined cultures, places and lands. Do not get confused over the word ‘church’, because it simply means ‘communion’ — ecclesia in Ancient Greek. It represents coming together in a community, in a sangha, to share the seeds of love and wisdom.

### The Church of Agape
*It has no fabric — only understanding.*

*It has no membership — save those who know they belong.*

*It has no rivals — because it is non-competitive.*

*It has no ambition, because it only seeks to serve.*

*It knows of no boundaries for nationalisms are unloving.*

*It is not of itself because it seeks to enrich all groups and religions.*

*It acknowledges all great teachers of all the ages who have shown the truth of Love. Those who participate, practice the Truth of Love in all their daily being.*

*There is no walk of life or nationality that is a barrier.*

*Those who are, know.*

*It seeks not to teach but to be, and by being, enrich.*

*It recognizes the collectivity of all humanity and that we are all one (…) that the time has come for the supreme transmutation, the ultimate alchemical act, the conscious change of the ego into a voluntary return to the whole.*

*It does not proclaim itself with a loud voice but in the subtle realms of loving.*

*It salutes all those in the past who have blazoned the path but paid the price.*

*It admits of no hierarchy or structure, for no one is greater than another.*

*Its members shall know each other by their deeds and being and their eyes and by no other outward sign, save the fraternal embrace.*

*Each one will dedicate his or her life to the silent loving of their neighbor and environment and the planet, whilst carrying out their daily task, however exalted or humble.*

*It recognizes the supremacy of the great idea which may only be accomplished if the human race practices the supremacy of Love.*

*It has no rewards to offer, either here or in the hereafter, save that of the ineffable joy of being and loving.*

*Its members shall seek only to advance the cause of understanding, within whichever church, group or family they happen to be.*

*They shall do good by stealth and teach only by example.*

*They shall heal their neighbor, their community and our planet (…)*

# Closing words

Agapism is a leaderless movement. It is apolitical and unaffiliated with any corporate or religious institution. Everyone is welcome to join.

It is time for us to learn how to love wisely. Many of us will be needed to change our current systems and societies. United in Agape, let us spread love and wisdom and heal the world.
